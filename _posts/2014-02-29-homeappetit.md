A weekly food delivery service based in Philadelphia.

The site had originally been built on Squarespace, but wasn't customizable enough. The biggest painpoint was that existing users would have constantly to re-enter their billing information every week.

I re-made the site in Wordpress, building a custom Stripe checkout plugin and backend system to simplify the owner's weekly grunt tasks. I also designed the UX and UI for the checkout process. I wanted to streamline the experience for both existing and first-time users.
