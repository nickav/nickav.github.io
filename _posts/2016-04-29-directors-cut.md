Created a Drone-powered Internet-of-Things Jackson Pollock splatter-painting where 200 people left their mark on a 15 ft canvas. Live-streamed to [Technica](http://gotechnica.org), University of Maryland's all-ladies hackathon.

Drone flew autonomously with an overhead OpenCV tracking camera and a Node.JS controller. I helped [Stef](http://stefcohen.com/) learn full-stack web dev. We built the website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Bash and Git.
